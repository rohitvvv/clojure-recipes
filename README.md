programming receipies.

### Might be Useful
1. To setup the environment you will need [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/#install)
2. You can use emacs as an editor. I use cider to do clojure development. Feel free to use [Cursive with Intellij](https://cursive-ide.com/) or [Counterclockwise with Eclipse](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Eclipse+and+Counterclockwise).
